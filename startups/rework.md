# Rework - Change the Way you Work Forever
- By Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson

## Chapter 1 -> First 

### The New Reality

- The thing is, anyone from anywhere with anyone or no one and anytime, who does or doesn't have plenty money, can start up. 
- You don't have to work 60-100 hours a week to make it work.
- It's high time now, it's time to Rework!
- And yes, business is not a dirty word!

## Chapter 2 -> Takedowns

### Ignore the Real World
- 'That would never work in the real world.' - Failed People.
- If you believe, then probably, you won't give a damn to these people. It's time to ignore such people.
- 'Real world isn't a place, it's an excuse, a justification for not trying.'
- These people usually try to drag you down and make you belive that this thing might not work in real world.
